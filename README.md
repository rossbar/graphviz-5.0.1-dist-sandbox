# Graphviz sandbox - pygraphviz wheelhouse

Mirror of the source code for the graphviz 5.0.1 release from:
https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/releases/5.0.1

This repo is intended for experimenting with wrapping graphviz to create
pygraphviz wheels, shortcutting the graphviz release process and
version-controlling wrapping attempts.

DO NOT USE THIS REPO TO BUILD/INSTALL GRAPHVIZ! Please refer to the
official [graphviz repo](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz).
